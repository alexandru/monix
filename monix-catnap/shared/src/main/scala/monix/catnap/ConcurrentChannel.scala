/**
  * The `ConcurrentChannel` can be used to model complex producer-consumer
  * communication channels.
  *
  * It exposes these fundamental operations:
  *
  *  - [[push]] for pushing single events to consumers (producer side)
  *  - [[pushMany]] for pushing event sequences to consumers (producer side)
  *  - [[halt]] for pushing the final completion event to all consumers (producer side)
  *  - [[consume]] for creating a [[ConsumerF]] value that can consume the
  *    incoming events from the channel
  *
  * ==Comparison with ConcurrentQueue==
  *
  * `ConcurrentChannel` is similar with a [[ConcurrentQueue]], but with these
  * added capabilities:
  *
  *  - [[consume]] can be applied multiple times, such that the same
  *    events can be broadcast to multiple consumers at the same time
  *  - [[halt]] for pushing a final completion event, closing the channel
  *    and disallowing other events from being pushed
  *
  * Also while you can see similarities between [[ConcurrentQueue.offer]]
  * and [[push ConcurrentChannel.push]] or between [[ConcurrentQueue.poll]]
  * and [[ConsumerF.pull]], note the different signatures:
  *
  * `ConcurrentChannel` has this restrictions: it needs to signal when the
  * channel has been closed for both the producers and the consumers.
  *
  * ==Example==
  *

  *     // Await for the completion of the consumers
  *     _ <- consumers_1_2.join
  *     _ <- consumers_3_4.join
  *   } yield ()
  * }}}
  *
  * ==Unicasting vs Broadcasting vs Multicasting==
  *
  * '''Unicasting''': Multiple workers can share the load of processing
  * incoming events. For example in case we want to have 8 workers running in
  * parallel, you can create one [[ConsumerF]], via [[consume]] and then use it
  * for multiple workers.
  *
  * '''Broadcasting:''' the same events can be sent to multiple consumers,
  * thus duplicating the load, as a broadcasting setup can be created
  * by creating and consuming from multiple [[ConsumerF]] via multiple calls
  * to [[consume]]. This setup assumes the channel's type is configured
  * as a multi-consumer one (e.g. [[ChannelType.MPMC MPMC]] or
  * [[ChannelType.SPMC SPMC]]).
  *
  * '''Multicasting:''' multiple producers can push events at the same time,
  * provided the channel's type is configured as a multi-producer one (e.g.
  * [[ChannelType.MPMC MPMC]] or [[ChannelType.MPSC MPSC]]).
  *
  * See [[consume]] for more details.
  *
  * ==Back-Pressuring and the Polling Model==
  *
  * The initialized channel can be limited to a maximum buffer size, a size
  * that could be rounded to a power of 2, so you can't rely on it to be
  * precise. Such a bounded queue can be initialized via
  * [[monix.catnap.ConcurrentChannel.bounded ConcurrentChannel.bounded]].
  * Also see [[monix.execution.BufferCapacity BufferCapacity]], the
  * configuration parameter that can be passed in the
  * [[monix.catnap.ConcurrentChannel.custom ConcurrentChannel.custom]]
  * builder.
  *
  * On [[push]], when the queue is full, the implementation back-pressures
  * until the channel has room again in its internal buffer(s), the future being
  * completed when the value was pushed successfully. Similarly [[ConsumerF.pull]]
  * (returned by [[consume]]) awaits the channel to have items in it. This
  * works for both bounded and unbounded channels.
  *
  * For both `push` and `pull`, in case awaiting a result happens, the
  * implementation does so asynchronously, without any threads being blocked.
  *
  * ==Multi-threading Scenario==
  *
  * This channel supports a [[monix.execution.ChannelType ChannelType]]
  * configuration, for fine tuning depending on the needed multi-threading
  * scenario. And this can yield better performance:
  *
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MPMC MPMC]]:
  *     multi-producer, multi-consumer
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MPSC MPSC]]:
  *     multi-producer, single-consumer
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.SPMC SPMC]]:
  *     single-producer, multi-consumer
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.SPSC SPSC]]:
  *     single-producer, single-consumer
  *
  * The default is `MPMC`, because that's the safest scenario.
  *
  * {{{
  *   import cats.effect.IO
  *   import monix.execution.ChannelType.MPSC
  *   import monix.execution.BufferCapacity.Bounded
  *
  *   val queue = ConcurrentChannel[IO].custom[Throwable, Int](
  *     capacity = Bounded(128),
  *     channelType = MPSC
  *   )
  * }}}
  *
  * '''WARNING''': default is `MPMC`, however any other scenario implies
  * a relaxation of the internal synchronization between threads.
  *
  * This means that using the wrong scenario can lead to severe
  * concurrency bugs. If you're not sure what multi-threading scenario you
  * have, then just stick with the default `MPMC`.
  *
  * ==Credits==
  *
  * Inspired by Haskell's
  * [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Concurrent-ConcurrentChannel.html Control.Concurrent.ConcurrentChannel]],
  * but note that this isn't a straight port â€” e.g. the `ConcurrentChannel` is
  * back-pressured and allows for termination (via [[halt]]), which changes
  * its semantics significantly.
